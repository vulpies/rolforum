That means that, if,on the site, the users deside to start a game based on \"Romeo and Juliette\", there will be only one player across all site playing Romeo. However, the same user can play King Lear in a different game based on another Shakespeare's drama.</p><p>The game is divided into \"episodes\" - small scenes with logical start and finish, like chapters in the book.Players describe the actions of their characters in turn, one after another, in a form of posts - small chunks of text together forming a coherent story.</p><p>The players are not restricted to always play in one setting, they can choose to merge different universes together or to move a character from one story into the reality of another story. Such games are called crossovers.They can choose to change the setting drastically, move medieval characters into a modern world or vise versa,and such a game would be called \"alternative universe\" (AU).</p>"
